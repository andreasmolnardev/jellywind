# Jellywind

Are you curious regarding your listening history?

Similar to Spotify Wrapped, Jellywind is a way to visualize your listening journey.

## How can I use it?

There are two methods you can use Jellywind:

1. Use the hosted GitHub Page I set up for it.
2. Install it yourself - your one docker compose file away from it
